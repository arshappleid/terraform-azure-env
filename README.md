# Terraform Env with Cloud Cli tools
This project is a template to use for terraform Projects, which comes with AWS Cli tools preinstalled. Installation of the cli tools can can configured from the Docker compose files. Additionally tools for terraform linting (TFLint) and Terraform Security have been pre installed. Additionally this project has been configured with VSCode Extensions to lint and run the security config check on each 

This project ensures that AWS/Azure Credentials for different projects remain contained within the Docker environment. Which mitigates the risk of accidentally deploying into an unknown account. Although requires configuring the account logins through single-sign on on each new project. 

## Benefits
1. Setup new environments for new project by just cloning the repo.
2. Easily install AWS/Azure Cli tools. Also comes pre installed with linting and security config checking tools
3. Easily manage login credentials within directories, rather than having to worry about managing through x
